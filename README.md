# go_moku_bot
Here you will find some incomplete code that will, or should, one day be a functioning gomoku bot.
It's based on Monte_Carlo Tree Search.

Also included are a class that defines the game gomoku and a file that runs a competition between multiple players. These belong to my teacher.  
[This is where I'd insert a link to the repository where that code came from, but it doesn't exist]
